for setup, see the setup section.


``fre``
=======

Brief rundown of commands also provided below:

* Enter commands and follow ``--help`` messages for guidance 
* If the user just runs ``fre``, it will list all the command groups following ``fre``, such as
  ``run``, ``make``, ``pp``, etc. and once the user specifies a command group, the list of available
  subcommands for that group will be shown
* Commands that require arguments to run will alert user about missing arguments, and will also list
  the rest of the optional parameters if ``--help`` is executed
* Argument flags are not positional, can be specified in any order as long as they are specified
* Can run directly from any directory, no need to clone repository
* May need to deactivate environment and reactivate it in order for changes to apply
* ``fre/setup.py`` allows ``fre/fre.py`` to be ran as ``fre`` on the command line by defining it as an
  *entry point*. Without it, the call would be instead, something like ``python fre/fre.py``


``fre app``

``fre catalog``
===============

``fre cmor``
============

This set of tools leverages the external ``cmor`` python package within the ``fre`` ecosystem. ``cmor`` is an
acronym for "climate model output rewriter". The process of rewriting model-specific output files for model
intercomparisons (MIPs) using the ``cmor`` module is, quite cleverly, referred to as "CMORizing".
